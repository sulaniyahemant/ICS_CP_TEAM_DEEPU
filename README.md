This C code is a simple area calculator for various geometric shapes based on user input. Let's break it down step by step

1. #include <stdio.h>: 
   This line includes the standard input/output library, allowing the program to perform input and output operations.

2. int main() {
   This is the beginning of the main function, the entry point of the program.

3. Variable declarations:
   int choice;: Declares an integer variable choice to store the user's menu selection.

    Various float variables (side, base, length, breadth, height, area, radius, major_axis, minor_axis, outer_radius, inner_radius, diagonal_1, diagonal_2) are declared to hold different          parameters for calculating areas of various shapes.

4.printf statements:
  These lines print the options for shapes to calculate their areas.

5.printf("Enter the choice\n");
 Prompts the user to enter their choice.

6.scanf("%d", &choice);
 Reads the user's choice of shape.

7switch (choice) {
 Starts a switch statement based on the user's choice.

8.case statements:
  Each case statement handles a specific shape choice entered by the user.
It prompts for necessary inputs, reads them using scanf, calculates the area based on the formulas for the respective shapes, and prints the result using printf.

9.break;
 Terminates each case block in the switch statement.

10.default::
   This is executed when the user enters a choice that doesn't match any of the cases in the switch statement.

11.printf("Error in choice\n");
  Informs the user about the incorrect choice.

12.return 0;
   Indicates the end of the main function and returns 0, signifying successful execution of the program.

Overall, this code allows the user to select various shapes, input their required parameters, calculates the respective areas based on the selected shape, and displays the results.
